# A Meta-analysis of the Environmental Drivers Contributing to Dreissend Invasional Success

## Introduction

Meta-analysis of the correlates driving dreissenid mussel distribution on the 
landscape and  dreissenid mussels' biophysical responses to those correlates.

## Structure

This Github repository is designed such that each sub-directory corresponds to
a portion of the analysis, with two primary sections: 'Correlates Analysis' and 
'Biophysical Analysis'. Each primary section is structured to have three internal
divisions, corresponding to the search structure, paper review and analysis phases.
These divisions were chosen to provide maximum transparency such that search aims,
results and analysis are presented independently.
